# Project 3 - DA Job Posting Analysis
## Project Proposal
#### The Bureau of Labor and Statistics expects the number of hired Data Analysts to grow by [25%](doc:https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/operations-research-analysts.htm) during the decade from 2020 to 2030. To better prepare ourselves getting into such a fast-growing filed with constant envolving, we are in urge of finding out what are the in-demand data analyst skills in the current business. 

#### With that in mind, We found a [dataset](doc:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukebarousse/data-analyst-job-postings-google-search) from kaggle with almost daily updates that pulls job posting from from Google's search results for Data Analyst positions in the United States. To better understand the data that was collected, we are building an interface using Python, SQLite, HTML, CSS, JS, Flask, Leaflet that allow us to showcase the following data visualizations:  
 - Geomap showcases the the tendency of data analyst job in demand across the country.
 - Job posting overview matrix displays 
   - the top XX websites that the company choose for job postings; 
   - the median hourly rate and anually salary for data analyst position; 
   - the proportion of remote works VS In-Person/Hybrid
 - Analysis on the most required skills and the skill worth.
 - Comparasion between the most required skills in job posting and the practices that the most popuar online Boot Camps have to offer.
